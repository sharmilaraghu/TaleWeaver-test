# TaleWeaver

**TaleWeaver turns everyday objects into magical stories.**

A voice-first interactive storytelling app for kids aged **4–10**, powered by **Google Gemini Live API**.

Children simply pick a storyteller, hold up a toy or draw an idea, and begin a **real-time conversation** where the AI and child co-create a story together.

Using **Gemini Live**, the storyteller speaks, listens, adapts to interruptions, and generates illustrations as the adventure unfolds.

Kids don't just listen to a story — **they shape it.**

# The Experience

Children start a story in **three magical ways**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/2. Pick mode.png" alt="Choose How to Start" width="800"/>
</p>

---

### 1. Pick a Theme

Choose from adventure themes or life-skills topics

Or type **anything their imagination invents**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/3. Pick a theme.png" alt="Pick a Theme" width="800"/>
</p>

If a custom theme isn't appropriate for children, a friendly message blocks it before the story starts.

</p>

---

### 2. Magic Camera

Hold up **any toy or object**.

The AI will:

1. Recognise the object
2. Transform it into a **storybook character**
3. Turn it into the **hero of the story**

Examples:

```
Stuffed penguin   → A fluffy penguin pal
LEGO rocket    → Galactic rescue pilot
```

  <img src="images/5. Magic camera - image.png" alt="Magic Camera - Illustrated" width="400"/>
</p>

---

### 3. Sketch a Theme

Kids can **draw anything** on a canvas.

The AI turns the drawing into a **storybook illustration** and starts a story around it.

Draw mountains, a house, a robot, a dragon, a castle, a flying whale — and watch it come to life.

  <img src="images/7. Sketch - image.png" alt="Sketch - Illustrated" width="400"/>
</p>

# A Living, Illustrated Story

Unlike traditional story generators, TaleWeaver is **fully conversational**. Children can interrupt the storyteller, change the story direction, add characters, and invent new twists at any moment.

```
AI:    The ant, the ladybug, and the fairy were tired after their long journey...

Child: Make a cloud their bed!

AI:    And just like that, a soft fluffy cloud floated down,
       curling around them like the cosiest bed in the world!
```

Barge-in is native — Gemini detects when the child starts speaking, stops the current narration, and weaves their words into the next story beat.

As the story unfolds, **illustrations appear automatically**. Gemini decides the right visual moment — a new location, character reveal, or dramatic transformation — and generates an image from its own scene description, so it always matches what was just narrated. Each new image receives the **previous image as context**, keeping characters and art style consistent across every scene.

</p>

# Creativity Rewards

TaleWeaver recognises and celebrates when a child contributes something genuinely imaginative.

When a child suggests a wild idea, invents a new character name, or takes the story in an unexpected direction, **Gemini awards them a creativity badge** on the spot.

The badge appears in the centre of the screen and auto-dismisses after a few seconds — a small moment of delight that tells the child their imagination matters.

Badges are saved with the story and shown in the **Story Recap** and **Past Adventures gallery**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/8. Creative badge.png" alt="Creative Badge Award" width="800"/>
</p>

---

# Story Recap

When the adventure ends, the app generates a **storybook recap**.

All session images are sent to Gemini, which generates a title and per-scene narrations in parallel. Original session images are reused — no new images generated during recap.

Children get a scrollable storybook with title, illustrated scenes, narration captions, and creativity badges. All saved to the **Past Adventures gallery**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/11. Story Recap.png" alt="Story Recap Storybook" width="800"/>
</p>

All completed stories are saved locally and accessible from the landing page. Tap any card to re-read the full storybook.

```

```
Child opens app → Landing page (ambient music, floating animations)
    → "Begin Your Adventure" → Choose a storyteller character
    → ThemeSelect
        Option A: Pick a Theme — 12 adventure tiles + 5 life skills + free-text custom
        Option B: Magic Camera — live viewfinder → capture prop → safety check
                  → AI labels prop → character speaks the label aloud
                  → AI recreates prop as storybook illustration → confirm & start
        Option C: Sketch a Theme — draw on canvas (19 colours) → AI labels sketch
                  → character speaks the label aloud
                  → AI recreates drawing as illustration → confirm & start

    → Story starts → WebSocket connects to backend → backend proxies to Gemini Live API
        → character system prompt + voice sent to Gemini
        → Gemini begins narrating immediately
        → mic capture starts (16kHz audio streamed to Gemini in real time)

Story plays
    → Gemini speaks → audio streamed to browser → played through speakers
    → Gemini triggers illustration at key visual moments
        → POST /api/image with Gemini's scene description
        → previous image passed for visual continuity
        → image fades in alongside the story
    → Fallback: if no illustration triggered in ~25 s, one is generated from the last narration

Achievement badges
    → Gemini awards a badge when the child makes a genuine creative contribution
    → Badge appears on screen, auto-dismisses after 3 s

Pause / Resume
    → Pause mutes playback and suspends mic — session stays alive
    → Resume restores both

Child interrupts (barge-in)
    → Gemini detects speech → stops current narration
    → weaves child's words into the next story beat

Session ends (child says stop or presses End Story)
    → story + badges saved to local gallery automatically
    → "📖 See our story!" button appears
    → POST /api/story-recap with all session images
        → Gemini generates title + per-image narration captions in parallel
    → scrollable storybook rendered and saved to gallery

Past Adventures (landing page)
    → story card grid (thumbnail, title, date)
    → tap any story → full storybook with narrations, badges, "The End"
```

# Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="architecture-v1.svg" alt="TaleWeaver Architecture" width="900"/>
</p>

### Data flow

```
Browser (React)
  ├── WebSocket /ws/story ───────→ Backend → Gemini Live API (Vertex AI)
  │     bidirectional audio/text proxy; no audio stored server-side
  ├── POST /api/check-theme ─────→ Backend → Flash Lite (safety check)
  ├── POST /api/sketch-preview ──→ Backend → Flash Lite (label) + image gen (illustration)
  ├── POST /api/tts ─────────────→ Backend → gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts (character voice)
  ├── POST /api/image ───────────→ Backend → safety filter → Gemini image gen (scene illustrations)
  └── POST /api/story-recap ─────→ Backend → Flash Lite (title + per-scene narrations, parallel)
```

### Session start (critical path)

The backend ensures the first audio frame Gemini produces is never dropped:

1. Opens the Gemini Live WebSocket
2. Starts both proxy tasks (browser ↔ Gemini) concurrently
3. Sends "Begin!" to Gemini only after both tasks are running and ready to forward data
4. Gemini's audio response streams through immediately as it arrives

### Audio pipeline

- **Capture:** Mic → 16kHz PCM → WebSocket → Gemini Live (streamed in real time)
- **Playback:** Gemini → 24kHz PCM → scheduled audio playback → speakers
  - Chunks are scheduled precisely to handle bursts where Gemini streams faster than real-time
  - AudioContext starts after mic permission is granted (Safari compatibility)

### Image generation

Two paths, both hitting `POST /api/image`:

1. **Primary:** Gemini decides the right visual moment and writes a scene description. Image is generated immediately with no extra processing step.
2. **Fallback:** fires if no image has been triggered in ~25 s. Uses the last narration as the scene description. Rate-limited to avoid flooding.

Each request passes the previous image as reference for visual continuity.

### Deployment

- Single Cloud Run service — multi-stage Docker: Node 22 builds React, Python 3.13 serves API + static files
- Single async worker, optimised for WebSocket-heavy I/O
- CI/CD: push to `main` → Cloud Build → Artifact Registry → Cloud Run
- Secrets: `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Secret Manager; GCP auth via Application Default Credentials

# Reproducible Testing

The app is live at **https://taleweaver-950758825854.us-central1.run.app** — no account, no setup required.

### Quick start (2 minutes)

1. Open https://taleweaver-950758825854.us-central1.run.app on a device with a microphone
2. Click **Begin Your Adventure**
3. Pick any storyteller (try **Wizard Wally** for English, **Dadi Maa** for Hindi, **Mamie Claire** for French)
4. Choose **Pick a Theme** → select an adventure (e.g. "Space Adventure") or type anything custom
5. Allow microphone access when prompted — the session starts immediately
6. The character will start narrating within a few seconds — speak to redirect the story

### Feature checklist

| Feature | How to test |
|---|---|
| **Voice narration starts automatically** | After clicking Begin, the character speaks within 2–3 s with no prompting |
| **Barge-in / interruption** | Speak while the character is talking — narration stops, your words are woven in |
| **AI-generated illustrations** | Images appear as the story progresses; each matches the current scene |
| **Visual continuity** | Characters look the same across multiple images in the same session |
| **Magic Camera** | On ThemeSelect, choose "Magic Camera", hold up any toy, tap the shutter; see it reimagined as a storybook character and become the story's hero |
| **Sketch a Theme** | Choose "Sketch a Theme", draw anything, see it recreated as a storybook illustration |
| **Achievement badge** | Suggest a creative story idea ("add a flying whale!") — a badge may appear on screen |
| **Pause / Resume** | Tap the pause button mid-story; tap again to resume from the same point |
| **End Story + Recap** | Tap "End Story" — the "📖 See our story!" button appears; open it for the illustrated storybook |
| **Past Adventures** | Go back to home; tap "Past Adventures" to see and re-read all saved stories |
| **Multilingual** | Pick **Dadi Maa** (Hindi), **Raja Vikram** (Tamil), **Yé Ye** (Mandarin), **Abuelo Miguel** (Spanish), or **Mamie Claire** (French) — each stays in their language even if the child speaks English |
| **Content moderation** | On "Pick a Theme → Custom theme", type something inappropriate — it will be blocked with a friendly message |
| **Life skills themes** | Pick any character → "Pick a Theme" → select a life skill tile (Sharing, Courage, etc.) |

# Roadmap

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Live Camera in Story Mode** | Prototyped but pulled — camera active during narration caused Gemini to break story focus and acknowledge the camera directly. Needs a more seamless integration. |
| **Rive Animated Characters** | Replace Framer Motion portraits with Rive state machine animations — real lip-sync tied to audio amplitude. Blocked on Rive asset creation for all 10 characters. |
| **Learning Mode** | Storyteller weaves curriculum goals (phonics, counting, colours) into the narrative without the child realising they're learning. |
| **Cloud Storage for Past Adventures** | Move from `localStorage` to GCS — images persist across devices and sessions indefinitely, no 20-story cap. |
