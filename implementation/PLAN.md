# TaleWeaver — Interactive Storytelling for Kids
### Build Plan (updated 1 Mar 2026)

---

## Overview

A voice-driven, kid-friendly web app where a child talks with a beloved storyteller character
and listens to a live, improvised story — with AI-generated illustrations appearing as the
tale unfolds.

**Live:** https://taleweaver.online

**Key differentiator:** Gemini Live native audio API — true bidirectional conversation,
the child can interrupt, redirect, or react at any moment. Illustrations are generated
asynchronously against the live story context so images actually match what's being told.

---

## Phase 0 — Landing Page & Character Selection ✅ DONE

- Ambient landing page: Framer Motion floating elements (stars, sparkles, clouds), background music, Gemini branding, single "Begin Your Adventure" CTA
- `CharacterSelect`: 5 English + 5 Indian storytellers in two rows with Indian Languages divider
- PNG character portraits (replaced planned SVGs)
- Screen transitions: fade-out on select, fade-in on story screen
- Back navigation throughout

See `PHASE_0_CHARACTER_SELECTION.md` for details.

---

## Phase 1 — Live Audio Backend ✅ DONE

- FastAPI WebSocket endpoint `/ws/story`
- Bidirectional proxy: browser ↔ Gemini Live API
- GCP OAuth2 auth server-side (credentials never leave backend)
- Character config loaded from `characters.py` by `character_id`
- Full Gemini Live setup: system prompt, voice, affective dialog, VAD, proactive audio
- VAD tuned to LOW sensitivity (both start and end) with 2000ms silence window
- "Begin!" trigger sent after setup with explicit theme instruction to start proactive character speech
- Graceful teardown on disconnect from either side
- `POST /api/image`: two-stage pipeline (Flash Lite scene extraction → Gemini image gen)
- React SPA served via `FileResponse` catch-all in `main.py`

See `PHASE_1_LIVE_API_BACKEND.md` for details.

---

## Phase 2 — Frontend Audio Pipeline ✅ DONE

- `capture.worklet.js`: Float32 → Int16, 16kHz, 1024-sample chunks → base64 → WebSocket
- `playback.worklet.js`: FIFO queue, Int16 → Float32, 24kHz, instant clear on interrupt
- `useLiveAPI` hook: full session state machine (`idle → connecting → ready → active → ended`)
- Barge-in: child interrupts at any time, Gemini VAD handles it natively
- Real-time audio visualiser on mic and playback streams

See `PHASE_2_AUDIO_STREAMING.md` for details.

---

## Phase 3 — Story Scene Images ✅ DONE

- Image trigger fires at `turnComplete` with full accumulated turn text
- Rate limit: configurable (default 10s), **no scene cap** — images generated for entire session
- `POST /api/image` → Flash Lite extracts specific English visual scene → Gemini generates image
- Visual continuity: reference image + continuity instructions keep characters consistent across scenes
- 8-second session startup delay before first image
- `StorySceneGrid`: horizontally scrollable, shimmer skeleton → fade-in
- 429 rate-limit handling: silently discard, reset timer so next turn can retry

See `PHASE_3_STORY_VISUALIZATION.md` for details.

---

## Phase 4 — Characters & UI ✅ DONE

- `StoryScreen`: 1/5 character portrait panel + 4/5 scene canvas
- PNG portraits for all 10 story characters
- **Per-state Framer Motion animations** on portrait:
  - `idle`: slow breathing scale (4s, easeInOut)
  - `thinking`: side-to-side sway + floating 💭 bubble
  - `speaking`: fast scale pulse (0.45s) + 3 expanding sound-wave rings
  - `listening`: gentle vertical bob (2.5s, cyan border)
- Border colour cycles per state: gold/40 → violet/60 → gold → cyan/70
- `key={characterState}` on portrait ensures clean Framer Motion remount on state change
- `AudioVisualizer`: real-time waveform
- Ambient landing page with `FloatingElements`

**Still deferred:**
- Rive/Lottie animated avatars with lip-sync tied to audio amplitude (see Stretch Goal 10)

See `PHASE_4_CHARACTER_ANIMATION.md` for details.

---

## Phase 4.5 — Theme Selection ✅ DONE

A screen inserted between `CharacterSelect` and `StoryScreen`.

**Three options:**

| Option | Status | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Pick a Theme | ✅ Done | Grid of 12 adventure tiles + 5 life skills tiles + free-text custom input |
| Magic Camera | ✅ Done | Live camera viewfinder; captures prop photo → safety check → AI recreates as storybook illustration → confirm & start |
| Sketch a Theme | ✅ Done | Drawing canvas with 19 colours → AI recreates as storybook illustration → confirm & start |

**Implementation details:**
- `ThemeSelect.tsx`: AnimatePresence accordion expand/collapse; `overflow-y-auto` cards container
- Camera capture: resized to max 512px JPEG, base64 stored in state
- Sketch canvas: 19-colour palette, submit sends drawing to `/api/sketch-preview` for AI recreation
- Sequential backend processing for sketch: label extracted first (Flash Lite, 15s timeout), then passed as `subject_hint` to image gen — ensures label matches image
- Theme + prop_image wired through full stack: `App.tsx` → `StoryScreen` → `useLiveAPI` → WebSocket → `proxy.py`
- `proxy.py` sends three-branch `Begin!` turn: camera_prop (multimodal inline_data) / theme name / plain

---

## Phase 4.6 — Content Moderation ✅ DONE

All content entry points (typed theme, camera prop, sketch) safety-checked before story starts.

- `_is_safe_for_children(content: str) -> bool` — Flash Lite classifier, 6s timeout, fails open
- Blocks: violence, weapons, blood, death, horror, adult/sexual, drugs, hate speech, self-harm, war, terrorism
- `/api/check-theme` endpoint for typed custom themes
- Safety check runs after label extraction in `/api/sketch-preview`; raises HTTP 400 `unsafe_content` if unsafe
- Frontend shows friendly "🚫 That theme isn't available" message with suggestion to try something else
- Camera preview shows 🚫 with explanation when unsafe content detected

---

## Phase 5 — Story Pre-warm ✅ DONE

Zero blank canvas: a story opening + first illustration are generated the moment StoryScreen mounts, so the canvas is never empty and Gemini Live continues mid-scene rather than starting cold.

See `PHASE_5_STORY_PREWARM.md` for full details.

---

## Phase 6 — Deployment & Production Hardening ✅ DONE

- Cloud Run service: `https://taleweaver-950758825854.us-central1.run.app`
- Custom domain: **https://taleweaver.online** (mapped via GCP Cloud Run domain mapping)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: `node:22-slim` builds React → `python:3.13-slim` serves both
- Cloud Build CI/CD via `cloudbuild.yaml` — auto-deploys on push to `main`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` in GCP Secret Manager, injected at runtime via `--update-secrets`
- CORS locked to taleweaver.online, www.taleweaver.online, Cloud Run URL, localhost dev ports
- 15-minute WebSocket session timeout

See `PHASE_6_DEPLOYMENT.md` for details.

---

## Phase 7 — Engagement & Vision

### 7.1 Camera Vision (Gemini sees the child) ✅ DONE

Live webcam feed piped into Gemini Live session alongside audio at 1 FPS.

- `useCameraStream` hook inside `useLiveAPI.ts`
- 1 FPS: canvas resize to max 512px → JPEG → WebSocket `realtime_input.media_chunks`
- Camera toggle in `StoryScreen` left panel (opt-in, off by default)
- Mirrored video preview for child; Gemini receives unmirrored frame

### 7.2 Movement Challenges ("Hero's Tasks") ⬜ PLANNED

Storyteller embeds physical challenges into the narrative; Gemini watches via camera (7.1 ✅) and reacts when it detects movement.

### 7.3 Story Branching (Choice Buttons) ✅ DONE

At key story moments Gemini presents 2–3 choices the child picks from.

- Gemini calls `showChoice` tool with `{ options: ["…", "…"] }`
- `pendingChoiceRef` pattern: queues tool call result, dispatches 700ms after `turnComplete` (ensures audio drains before overlay appears)
- `ChoiceOverlay` renders at top of scene canvas — tappable buttons
- Child taps OR speaks any response → overlay dismisses
- `answerChoice` sends both `toolResponse` + `client_content` so Gemini resumes immediately
- `onChildSpoke` callback fires on `sc.interrupted` or `sc.inputTranscription.finished` → clears overlay
- System prompt: `showChoice` called AT MOST ONCE per session

### 7.4 Achievement / Badge System ✅ DONE

- Gemini calls `award_badge` tool for genuine creative contributions
- `BadgePopup` appears centred on screen, auto-dismisses after 3s
- Criteria: child suggests story ideas, picks brave/creative options, does a physical challenge, chooses to end the story
- Explicitly prohibited: turning on camera, random movement, being quiet, just joining the session

## End-to-End Session Flow

```
Child opens app → Landing page (ambient music, floating animations)
    → "Begin Your Adventure" → CharacterSelect
    → selects a character → ThemeSelect
        Option A: Pick a theme tile (Animals / Space / Ocean… / Life Skills) or type custom
                  → custom text → /api/check-theme safety check
        Option B: Magic Camera — capture prop photo → safety check → AI recreates → confirm
        Option C: Sketch a Theme — draw on canvas → /api/sketch-preview → AI recreates → confirm
    → "Begin the Story!" → StoryScreen mounts

    [PRE-WARM — runs in background while child sees the character]
    → POST /api/story-opening (Flash Lite opening + image gen, ~5-8s)
        → STORY: 3-4 sentence opening in character's language
        → SCENE: English painter's description for image gen
        → first illustration rendered → seedInitialImage → canvas shows image
    → "Begin the Story!" button enables

    → useLiveAPI.connect()
        → WebSocket → backend /ws/story (with opening_text in handshake)
        → backend: load character config
        → backend: connect to Gemini Live API
        → backend: send setup (system prompt + voice + VAD LOW + tools)
        → backend: send "Begin!" + opening_text suffix → Gemini continues mid-scene
        → Gemini: setupComplete → frontend: sessionState = "active"
        → mic capture starts (16kHz PCM via AudioWorklet)

Story plays
    → Gemini continues the story from the pre-generated opening
    → 24kHz PCM audio chunks → playback worklet → speakers
    → outputTranscription accumulates per turn
    → Gemini calls generate_illustration tool at vivid moments → forceImageGeneration (bypass rate limit, skip_extraction)
    → turnComplete fallback → triggerImageGeneration at configured interval
        → Flash Lite extracts scene → image gen
        → base64 → StorySceneGrid: shimmer → fade-in (previous image fed for continuity)
        → continues generating until session ends (no scene cap)

Story branching (at most once per session)
    → Gemini calls showChoice tool → stored in pendingChoiceRef
    → turnComplete + 700ms → ChoiceOverlay renders
    → child taps button → toolResponse + client_content sent → Gemini continues
    → OR child speaks → onChildSpoke → overlay dismissed

Achievement badges
    → Gemini calls award_badge for genuine creative engagement
    → BadgePopup appears centred, auto-dismisses after 3s

Child interrupts
    → VAD detects speech → playback clears, choice overlay dismissed
    → Gemini weaves child's words into the next story beat
```

## What Remains

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rive lip-sync avatars | Low | Highest visual impact but very high effort |
| Cloud Storage for images | Low | Reduces memory, enables story gallery |
| Story Gallery | Low | Deferred — removed from landing page |
