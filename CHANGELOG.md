## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-26

- **3 new Indian story characters** — Ammamma (Telugu, voice: Zephyr), Aaji (Marathi, voice: Autonoe), Dida (Bengali, voice: Umbriel)
- **`StudyCharacterSelect`** screen — 2×2 grid of study characters with green/teal theme
- **Full app routing** — 5 screens: `landing | story-select | story | study-select | study` with back navigation
- **`isStudy` flag** on `Character` interface to separate story vs study characters
- **7 new SVG portraits** — Ammamma, Aaji, Dida, Count Cosmo, Dr. Luna, Professor Pip, Arty
- Visual keyword dictionary extended to Telugu, Marathi, Bengali for image trigger pre-filter
- Browser tab: `<title>TaleWeaver</title>` + book emoji favicon

### Changed
- `CharacterSelect` now shows 10 story characters in **two rows of 5** with 🇮🇳 Indian Languages divider
- Rolling story context extended from 600 → 2000 chars
- Image payload to backend extended from 400 → 2000 chars

### Fixed
- **Image quality** — images now fire at `turnComplete` with full turn text instead of a 20-word mid-sentence fragment; images now match the actual story being told
- Removed `>= 10 words` bypass in `useStoryImages` that allowed garbage through the keyword filter

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Story scene image generation** (`useStoryImages` hook + `POST /api/image` endpoint)
- Two-stage image pipeline: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` extracts English visual scene → `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001` generates image
- `StorySceneGrid` + `StorySceneCard` components with shimmer skeleton → fade-in transition
- `StorybookEmpty` placeholder illustration
- Client-side visual keyword pre-filter (English + Tamil + Hindi)
- 30-second rate limit, 20-second session startup delay, 8-image cap per session
- `IMAGE_MODEL` env var to switch between Imagen and Gemini image models
- 429 (rate limit) handling: silently discard card, reset timer for immediate retry next turn

### Changed
- `image_gen.py` refactored: separate `_generate_imagen()` and `_generate_gemini()` paths
- Scene extraction prompt improved for painter-level specificity
